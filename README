This repository contains test files used by the CloudHarmony network test 
harness (see https://github.com/cloudharmony/network). The test harness 
facilitates measurement of network characteristics including latency, 
throughput and DNS query performance. The files in this repository must be 
present on test nodes for downlink throughput tests. To install, clone this 
repository into an http accessible path on each test node (as designated by the
--throughput_uri runtime argument).

NOTE: This repository does not contain the 500MB test file due to github large
file restrictions. To use this size in downlink tests, either create the file 
manually using `dd if=/dev/urandom of=test500mb.bin bs=524288000 count=1` or 
download the full set of test files from
